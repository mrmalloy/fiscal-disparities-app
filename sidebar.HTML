<p>Since 1971, communities in the seven counties that make up the Twin Cities metropolitan area have participated in a property tax revenue-sharing program called Fiscal Disparities. The goal of the program is to encourage communities to pursue development that is more orderly, equitable, and friendly to non-revenue generating land uses. This is accomplished by pooling 40% of each community's commercial/industrial tax base growth since 1971, determining the average market value per person throughout the entire metro, and then redistributing income accordingly based on how each community's market value per person compares to the regional average. More information on Fiscal Disparities is available
